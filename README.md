Defi BUilder's AI system is a sophisticated ensemble of components, each designed to ensure the security, efficiency, and reliability of Ethereum smart contracts. The system comprises three main elements: the AI Generator Agent, the Builder Backend, and the AI Auditor Backend.

### AI Generator Agent

- **Purpose**: The AI Generator Agent is responsible for generating Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts.
- **Training and Data Sources**: This agent has been fine-tuned on over 300 verified smart contract primitives from cookbook.dev, enhancing its security and reliability. Additionally, it leverages a vast dataset from Hugging Face, comprising over 300,000 smart contracts, to incorporate user customizations and ensure a robust starting point for integrating user requests.
- **Functionality**: The agent intelligently processes user inputs and requirements to generate smart contract code that is not only functional but also adheres to best practices in smart contract development.

### Builder Backend

- **Role**: Once the AI Generator Agent produces a smart contract, the Builder Backend takes over.
- **Compilation and Syntax Checking**: Utilizing Hardhat, a popular Ethereum development environment, the backend verifies the compilation of the generated contract. This step is crucial to ensure that the contract is free of syntax errors and other common coding issues.
- **Error Handling**: If any errors are detected during the compilation process, the contract is sent back to the Generator Agent. The errors are provided as feedback, enabling the AI to learn and improve in subsequent iterations.

### AI Auditor Backend

- **Objective**: After a successful compilation, the AI Auditor Backend evaluates the smart contract for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Assessment and Categorization**: The AI Auditor is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset, including a public Hugging Face Q&A dataset with over 9,000 examples of potential vulnerabilities. This allows the AI to categorize vulnerabilities based on their security concerns (Low, Medium, High).
- **Audit Data Sources**: To enhance its auditing capabilities, the AI integrates models based on over 5,000 audits from various public reports on GitHub, sourced from more than 30 audit firms. This extensive dataset ensures a thorough and informed audit of the smart contracts.
